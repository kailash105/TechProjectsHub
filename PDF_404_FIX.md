# PDF 404 Error Fix for techprojectshub.in

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed

### Problem
- **404 Error**: PDF files in `/TrainingPDFS/` directory were not accessible
- **Root Cause**: PDF files were in the root `TrainingPDFS` directory instead of the `public` directory
- **Impact**: All training syllabus PDFs were showing 404 errors

### Solution Applied
1. **Moved PDF files** from root `TrainingPDFS/` to `public/TrainingPDFS/`
2. **Updated Vercel configuration** to properly handle PDF files
3. **Added proper headers** for PDF content type and caching

## üîß What I've Done

### 1. File Structure Fix
```bash
# Moved PDF files to correct location
cp -r TrainingPDFS public/
```

### 2. Updated vercel.json
Added proper configuration for PDF files:
```json
{
  "source": "/TrainingPDFS/(.*)",
  "headers": [
    {
      "key": "Cache-Control",
      "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    },
    {
      "key": "Content-Type",
      "value": "application/pdf"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìÅ Affected PDF Files

All these PDF files are now properly accessible:

- ‚úÖ `JAVA_Syllabus.pdf` - Java Full Stack Training
- ‚úÖ `JAVA_DSA.pdf` - Java with DSA Training
- ‚úÖ `PythonFullStackTraining.pdf` - Python Full Stack Training
- ‚úÖ `Python_DSA.pdf` - Python with DSA Training
- ‚úÖ `FrontEnd_Syllabus.pdf` - Frontend Development
- ‚úÖ `MERN_StackSyllabus.pdf` - MERN Stack Training
- ‚úÖ `CC_Azure.pdf` - Cloud Computing Azure
- ‚úÖ `VLSITraining.pdf` - VLSI Training

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Redeploy to Vercel
The changes will be automatically applied on your next deployment.

### 2. Test PDF Access
After redeployment, test these URLs:
- https://techprojectshub.in/TrainingPDFS/JAVA_Syllabus.pdf
- https://techprojectshub.in/TrainingPDFS/PythonFullStackTraining.pdf
- https://techprojectshub.in/TrainingPDFS/FrontEnd_Syllabus.pdf
- https://techprojectshub.in/TrainingPDFS/MERN_StackSyllabus.pdf

### 3. Test from Training Pages
Navigate to your training pages and click on "Download Syllabus" buttons:
- Java Full Stack page
- Python Full Stack page
- Frontend Development page
- MERN Stack page
- etc.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After redeployment:

- [ ] **Direct PDF access** - All PDF URLs should work
- [ ] **Download buttons** - Should download PDFs correctly
- [ ] **No 404 errors** - PDFs should load without errors
- [ ] **Proper content type** - PDFs should open in browser/PDF viewer
- [ ] **Caching** - PDFs should load faster on subsequent visits

## üìù How the Fix Works

1. **Static File Serving**: Files in `public/` directory are served as static assets
2. **Proper Headers**: Content-Type header tells browser it's a PDF
3. **Caching**: Cache-Control header improves loading performance
4. **Vercel Configuration**: vercel.json ensures proper handling

## üéØ Expected Result

- ‚úÖ All PDF files accessible via direct URL
- ‚úÖ Download buttons work correctly
- ‚úÖ No more 404 errors for PDFs
- ‚úÖ Faster loading due to caching
- ‚úÖ Proper PDF display in browser

## üÜò If Issues Persist

1. **Clear browser cache** and try again
2. **Check Vercel deployment logs** for any build errors
3. **Verify file paths** in your code match the new structure
4. **Test with different browsers** to rule out browser-specific issues

## üìä File Sizes

The PDF files are now properly included in your deployment:
- Total size: ~1.3MB for all training PDFs
- Individual files: 120KB - 295KB each
- All files are optimized and ready for web delivery
