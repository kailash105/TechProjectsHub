## How to Re-enable LMS
To re-enable the LMS functionality:

1. **Backend (`backend/server.js`)**:
   - Uncomment all route imports
   - Uncomment all route usage (`app.use('/api/lms/*', ...)`)
   - Uncomment MongoDB connection
   - Uncomment Socket.IO LMS functionality

2. **Frontend (`src/App.jsx`)**:
   - Uncomment all LMS component imports
   - Uncomment all LMS routes

3. **Other files**:
   - Restore original API base URL in `src/utils/api.js`
   - Uncomment LMS links in `src/components/Footer.jsx`
   - Restore socket functionality in `src/utils/socket.js`
   - Update `src/utils/ProtectedRoute.jsx` redirects

## Notes
- All LMS code is preserved and commented out, not deleted
- The website remains fully functional for non-LMS features
- Database and backend infrastructure can be restored when hosting issues are resolved
- Users trying to access LMS pages will be redirected to the home page

## Status
**Current Status**: LMS Temporarily Disabled
**Main Website**: ✅ Fully Functional
**Backend Server**: ✅ Running (without database)
**Deployment**: ✅ Ready for deployment without LMS dependencies
**Build Status**: ✅ No syntax errors
**Development Server**: ✅ Running successfully
