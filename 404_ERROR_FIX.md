# 404 Error Fix for techprojectshub.in

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. SPA Routing Issue (404 on refresh)
- **Problem**: Vercel doesn't know how to handle client-side routing
- **Solution**: Created `vercel.json` with rewrite rules to redirect all routes to `index.html`

### 2. Import Typo in About.jsx
- **Problem**: Extra 'n' in import statement causing syntax error
- **Solution**: Fixed the import statement

## üîß What I've Done

### Created `vercel.json` Configuration
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/Home/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration tells Vercel to:
1. **Rewrite all routes** to serve `index.html` (enables client-side routing)
2. **Cache static assets** for better performance

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Redeploy to Vercel
The `vercel.json` file will be automatically detected and applied on your next deployment.

### 2. Test the Fix
After redeployment, test these scenarios:
- [ ] Visit https://techprojectshub.in
- [ ] Navigate to different pages (About, Services, etc.)
- [ ] **Refresh the page** on any route - should work now
- [ ] **Direct URL access** - should work now

### 3. Set Environment Variables (Still Needed)
Don't forget to set these in Vercel dashboard:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com/api/lms
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After redeployment:

1. **Home Page**: https://techprojectshub.in/
2. **About Page**: https://techprojectshub.in/about
3. **Services Page**: https://techprojectshub.in/services
4. **Training Page**: https://techprojectshub.in/training
5. **Contact Page**: https://techprojectshub.in/contact

**Test each page by:**
- [ ] Direct URL access
- [ ] Navigation from other pages
- [ ] **Page refresh** (this was the main issue)

## üìù How the Fix Works

The `vercel.json` rewrite rule:
```json
{
  "source": "/(.*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}
```

This tells Vercel: "For any URL path, serve the `index.html` file instead of looking for a matching file." This allows React Router to handle the routing on the client side.

## üéØ Expected Result

- ‚úÖ No more 404 errors on page refresh
- ‚úÖ Direct URL access works
- ‚úÖ All routes function properly
- ‚úÖ Better caching for static assets

## üÜò If Issues Persist

1. **Check Vercel deployment logs** for any build errors
2. **Clear browser cache** and try again
3. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
4. **Verify the `vercel.json` file** is in your project root
